# Splitwise API Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual credentials

# Option 1: API Key (Recommended - simpler setup)
SPLITWISE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Option 2: OAuth credentials (Alternative if you don't have API key)
# SPLITWISE_CONSUMER_KEY=your_consumer_key_here
# SPLITWISE_CONSUMER_SECRET=your_consumer_secret_here

# Note: Get your API key from https://secure.splitwise.com/apps
# You only need either the API key OR the consumer key/secret pair, not both.
