> Hi

⏺ Hi! I'm SPLITSMART, your AI expense manager for Splitwise integration. Since my memory resets
  between sessions, I need to read my Memory Bank to understand the current context and any previous
   progress.

⏺ Perfect! I can see you've created a new branch mexico_trip. I've read my Memory Bank and confirmed
   UV is installed. I can see from the expense progress that no trip context has been set up yet.

  What trip are we processing expenses for? I'll need the trip name, dates, and who went so I can
  help you manage your Splitwise expenses.

  1. Combine all Uber trips into one $40.81 expense?
  2. Process each trip separately?
  3. Skip Uber expenses (too small/personal)?
